 - This Repo Represents **"Indian Food Classification"**
 - with the help of this project we can easily identity Indian Foods
 
# Description :clipboard:

 - I use Transfer learning (InceptionV3 Model) to create this model and got a 92% accuracy and I Perfrom some EDA 
   to check each classes and Check number of training examples of each food.

 - This project will help people from other countries to classify Indian food easily.
 - I also Perform Data Augmentation for increasing the number of training examples , Data Augmentation can also reduce Overfitting.
 - I use callbacks can helps you prevent overfitting, visualize training progress, debug your code, save checkpoints, generate logs etc.
 - I use InceptionV3 Pre-Trained and got Training Accuracy 93% , you can also use other Pre-Trained Model like ResNet50 , Vgg19 etc
 - I use Flask to create a Web app and make an easy or Simple UI

# Motivation ðŸ’ª 
 What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning and Deep learning 
 in last 8 months . I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to 
 work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.
